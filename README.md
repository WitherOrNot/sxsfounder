# sxsfounder

Creates foundation image from SxS components.

Requires manifests to be uncompressed, at root of SxS source folder. Use [SxSExpand](https://github.com/hfiref0x/SXSEXP) to convert existing SxS sources to this format if needed.

> DISCLAIMER: This code is very rough and thoroughly untested. If it deletes your Minecraft hardcore world or makes you grow a third head, that is strictly a "you" problem.

## Usage
`sxsfounder <sxs source folder> <deployment manifest> <offline image path>`
